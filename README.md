# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer-C
Sorting Algorithm Visualizer in C is a step-by-step implementation of classic sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. The project visualizes comparisons and swaps using array outputs, helping build strong fundamentals in algorithms, loops, functions, and logical problem-solving.


📊 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer in C

A step-by-step visualization of sorting algorithms implemented in C, designed to strengthen core algorithmic thinking by displaying how array elements move and get sorted at each step.

This project focuses on clarity, logic, and fundamentals, not shortcuts.

🚀 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:

Understand how sorting algorithms work internally

Visualize each comparison and swap

Build strong foundations in arrays, loops, functions, and algorithmic logic

Bridge the gap between theory and actual execution

🧠 Algorithms Implemented

The following sorting algorithms are included:

🔹 Bubble Sort

Repeatedly compares adjacent elements

Swaps them if they are in the wrong order

Easy to understand, slower for large datasets

Time Complexity

Best Case: O(n)

Average Case: O(n²)

Worst Case: O(n²)

🔹 Selection Sort

Selects the minimum element from the unsorted part

Places it at the correct position

Fewer swaps than Bubble Sort

Time Complexity

Best Case: O(n²)

Average Case: O(n²)

Worst Case: O(n²)

🔹 Insertion Sort (Optional Extension)

Sorts elements the way humans sort playing cards

Efficient for small or nearly sorted arrays

Time Complexity

Best Case: O(n)

Average Case: O(n²)

Worst Case: O(n²)

🧩 Visualization Approach

Arrays are displayed after each significant step

Every pass, comparison, and swap is printed

Helps track how elements gradually move to their correct positions

Designed to complement a physical sorting visualization model

🛠️ Concepts Used

Arrays (1D)

Nested loops

Functions

Conditional statements

Algorithmic thinking

Time complexity analysis

❌ No file handling
❌ No structures or unions

This ensures the project strictly focuses on core C fundamentals.
