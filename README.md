# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer-C
Sorting Algorithm Visualizer in C is a step-by-step implementation of classic sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort and Selection Sort. The project visualizes comparisons and swaps using array outputs, helping build strong fundamentals in algorithms, loops, functions, and logical problem-solving.
